# =============================================================================
#
# Note: The similarity between the original name of Michael Cohen's Ki
#       Statechart framework, which was later ported to SproutCore, and the
#       name Kivy, is purely coincidental.
#
# Note: The original license of Ki and of SC.Statechart is MIT, so this was
#       kept for kivy-statecharts while it was being ported and developed on
#       github.com/geojeff. It is something of an add-on to Kivy core, so
#       perhaps this is fine, but this can be reviewed for making changes
#       appropriate for living under the Kivy umbrella. The copyright lines
#       for Jeffrey Gill Pittman (geojeff) was removed on transfer to Kivy.
