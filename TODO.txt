TODO
====

- Settle the testing question: py.test, nose, or both?
- Add an example featuring history states.
- Simplify the coding of states by using get_running_app(), and/or by adding
  references to app and/or statechart.
- Change long paths in super() calls to wrap across lines -- is there a way to
  do this without the explicit paths?
- Document the need to an __init__() for states, or not, in relation to Kivy
  properties.
- Document the use of memory mapping tools used in the attempt to get the
  Deflectouch_with_statecharts example working on iOS.
- Generate a state diagram in outline form, perhaps to /tmp/out.html for use
  in live reporting during development (See kotti_software tests for the dc()
  method).
- Are the installation docs in the readme OK?
